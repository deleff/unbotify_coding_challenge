In order to run the script on mac or linux, make sure it is executable: 

**chmod 755 number_randomizer.sh**

then run the script: 

**./number_randomizer.sh**

The script will ask you to enter an integer, and then another one. 
If either value entered is not an integer,the script will exit.
If you entered two integers, it will print all integers between the two values you've supplied, in a random order
